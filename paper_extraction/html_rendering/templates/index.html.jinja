    <h2>How the Website is Built</h2>
    <p>This website is built using a workflow at <a href="https://lunarbase.ai/" target="_blank">Lunar</a> for automatically extracting and processing theoretical results from academic papers. The extraction process involves parsing LaTeX from PDFs and generating enriched content using GPT-4o and formal verification systems like Isabelle/HOL.</p>
